## 📌 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

**File:** `Task2_EDA.ipynb`
**Preview:** Analyzing datasets to uncover insights and patterns.

### 🔹 Features

* Visualized distributions, correlations, and trends
* Used **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for advanced plotting
* Created heatmaps and pairplots for deeper understanding

### 🔹 Learning Outcome

* Gained skills in data visualization
* Learned how to interpret patterns and correlations
* Improved decision-making using insights

## 📌 3. Machine Learning Model

**File:** `Task3_ML_Model.ipynb`
**Preview:** Building and evaluating machine learning models.

### 🔹 Features

* Implemented regression/classification algorithms
* Evaluated models using **accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, RMSE**
* Performed hyperparameter tuning for better performance

### 🔹 Learning Outcome

* Hands-on experience in ML workflows
* Understood model evaluation metrics
* Learned optimization techniques
